# PROJECT: HUGE-like Product Website (Layout + UX clone, content original)

## Goal
Build a high-performance product catalog website with a homepage layout and UX similar to huge-germany.com:
- Header with hotline + search + catalogue CTA
- Mega menu: product categories + collections/series + news + dealer system
- Homepage sections:
  1) Value propositions (4 cards)
  2) Product blocks per category with tabs + product grid + “View all”
  3) Featured news list
  4) Footer with company info + product categories + support policies + map
- Modal popup: “Đăng ký nhận Catalogue” form.

Do NOT copy their proprietary content, images, logos, or text. Use placeholders and make content configurable.

## Tech stack (default)
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- Data source: PostgreSQL + Prisma (or use a JSON seed first, then migrate)
- Search: simple full-text (Postgres) first; later upgrade to Meilisearch/Typesense if needed.
- Image: next/image, responsive.
- SEO: metadata, sitemap, robots, OG tags.
- i18n ready (vi/en/ja) but default vi.

## Pages / Routes
1) `/` Home
2) `/categories/[slug]` Category landing (filters, sort, pagination)
3) `/products/[slug]` Product detail (gallery, specs, related)
4) `/collections/[slug]` Collection/series list (ALADDIN/ALICE/…)
5) `/news` and `/news/[slug]`
6) `/dealers` dealer list + map embed
7) `/policies/[slug]` (privacy, shipping, return, warranty)
8) `/catalogue` optional page + also modal form on Home

## UX requirements
- Sticky header on scroll
- Search bar in header (typeahead optional)
- Product block on Home: tabs per subcategory; when switching tabs, keep section height stable to avoid layout shift.
- Product cards: image, name, short code, “NEW” badge, hover effects.
- Featured news: list cards with title + excerpt.
- Catalogue modal: name, address, phone, email, note; validation; success toast.

## Data model (minimum)
- Category(id, name, slug, parentId, order)
- Collection(id, name, slug, order)
- Product(id, name, slug, sku/code, isNew, categoryId, collectionId?, images[], shortDesc, specs(json), status)
- Post(id, title, slug, excerpt, content, category, publishedAt, heroImage)
- Dealer(id, name, address, phone, province, lat, lng)
- LeadCatalogue(id, fullName, address, phone, email, message, createdAt, source)

## Component library
- Header, MegaMenu, SearchBar
- HeroCarousel (optional)
- ValuePropsGrid(4 items)
- ProductSectionWithTabs
- ProductCard
- NewsSection
- Footer + MapEmbed
- CatalogueModal + Form

## Performance & quality bar
- Lighthouse > 90 on mobile for Home
- Avoid heavy client JS: server components by default, client only where needed (tabs, modal, search input).
- Use caching (Next fetch cache) and pagination.
- Validate forms server-side.
- No hardcoded strings; use i18n keys.

## Coding style
- Small components, clear props types.
- Prefer server actions (or API routes) for form submit.
- Provide seed scripts for demo data.
- Write minimal tests for critical utils.

## Deliverables per task
When implementing a feature:
1) Update routes
2) Add/modify DB schema (if needed)
3) Implement UI components
4) Wire data + error states + loading skeletons
5) Add i18n keys
6) Document how to run locally

## Acceptance criteria
- Home looks and behaves like the reference layout (structure/sections), but with original branding/content.
- Category navigation works; product detail works; news works; catalogue lead captured.
